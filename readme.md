# Insomnia Plugin for Fast-Weigh

The Insomnia Plugin for Fast-Weigh provides helpers for converting GraphQL queries to usable POST bodies. The goal is to make the transition from writing your query to actually using it in a reporting tool as smooth as possible. 

The plugin supports:

- Telerik
- Excel (coming soon)
- PowerBI (coming soon)

### To use:

Just right click the query you want to format and choose the appropriate type (Telerik, PowerQuery).

The query will be automatically copied to your clipboard and ready to paste into your tool of choice.
